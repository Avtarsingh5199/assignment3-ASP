# assignment3-ASP
hlo sir,
first of all really sorry for late submission
although i had done upto shop controller part in my student registration project, but somehow something happened to my controllers, i dont know what. 
It stop working, it was showing few errors,  i tried many ways- install nudget packages, remake controlers, migration etc, but dont work
I sent an email for extension as well but didnt get reply.
I thought to start from scratch but it would have taken few days.I already wasted my whole day and was late. So, taking code from your website helps me in continuing 3rd assignment.
After a lot of attempts, i became successful in connecting everything and started my 3rd assignment with the help of your videos.
Still, it took me more than 1 and half day.
i know it's wrong but i made few changes, i think i can get some marks instead of 0
I have seen all three videoa and understood nearly everything. if you want i can explain it

thank you
